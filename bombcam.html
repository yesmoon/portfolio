	<p class="project-body">
		In 2015, now-President Donald Trump had been making statements about having a database on the Syrian people in the United States. He made the following claims:
	</p>
	<p class="project-body quote">
		"I will absolutely take database on the people coming in from Syria,"<br>
		"If I win, they're going back. They're going back. We can't have them."<br>"I want surveillance of certain mosques, okay? If that's okay?"<br>
		"I want surveillance. And you know what? We've had it before, and we'll have it again."<br>
		"The database is okay. A watch list is okay and surveillance is okay ... I want surveillance of these people that are coming in, the Trojan horse. I want to know who the hell they are."
	</p>

	</div>
	<p class="project-body">
		In response to these statements, I created a hoax that promoted an app that visualized Trump’s wish to track Syrian refugees. The website is designed considering app website trends, utilizing features such as parallax scrolling.
	</p>
	<p class="project-body">
		While creating the website, I stumbled upon a PDF containing a list of Refugee Process Centers’ contact information all around the US, a document provided by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), uploaded publicly to the Refugee Processing Center (RPC) online. I added a link labeled <b>Emergency Contacts</b> on the navigation bar of the website that would take you to the external PDF uploaded on the official RPC website.
